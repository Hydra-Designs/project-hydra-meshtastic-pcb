A minimalist PCB design built around the Ebyte E22-900M30S 30dbm (1 watt) LoRA radio and the ESP32-WROOM-32U mpu compatible with the [Meshtastic-device](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-device) firmware.

## Features
- Supports up to 30dbm (1 watt) transmit power
- OLED support via I2C
- GPS support via UART
- PSRAM support
- User button via pin header
- Switchable 3.3V power rail (GPS power saving)
- ADC input for battery voltage sensing
- Single 5V input (no reverse polarity and overvoltage protection!)
- 3.3V output (or input if onboard buck converter is not assembled)
- Two GPIO reserved for future use (for example power control)
- Programmable via USB-Serial adapter (RTS/DTR are required for the on-board auto reset!)
- Compatible with "meshtastic-diy-v1" target


## Project status
- V1 has been assembled and is working fine. Gerbers are OK, no errors! Production files not verified and tested!
- Initial concept idea of V2 has been published, introduces breaking changes.
- Production file generation has not been verified yet, still needs some cleanup.
- Core PCB KiCad footprint and schematic symbol will be available afer the official V2 release.


## Assembly instructions
- Use the fancy iBom for reference!
- Start with the 3.3v step down regulator and test the 3.3v rail first.
- Assemble all the parts for the auto reset circuit and the ESP32 module. Don't forget to connect the 2.4G antenna!
- Try to program the core pcb next.
- Lastly, populate the RF modem. You can use a strip of cardboard as a spacer to leave a small gap between the two PCBs, in case the ESP32 releases it's magic smoke you can use solder wick to easily remove and reuse the RF modem.
- Never ever turn on the core pcb withount an antenna! This may infuriate the RF gods and you inevitably end up performing a sacrifial ritual to please the RF gods with magic smoke.
